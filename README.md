# Flappy-Pengu

## Description
A remake of 2014’s most popular mobile game Flappy Bird, I designed and constructed Flappy Pengu using the Unity game engine. In addition to coding in C#, I learned fundamental game design principles through making this game, including spawning objects, using physics principles, and implementing game logic.

## Future Improvements
This game is far from finished as I have many ideas that would make it more enjoyable:
- Increased speed of pipes as you keep going (would have to increase gravity and jump velocity to allow penguin to have sharper falls/jumps)
- Close pipes, add targets on pipes and give penguin ability to shoot bullets. Hitting target would open pipes. (could be separate game mode as well)
- Retain high score in user's hard drive
- Add flapping animation
- Add moving background
